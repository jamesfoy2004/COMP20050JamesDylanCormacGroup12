CHANGES

-default colour of hexagons is now grey

-getHexID() edited so that the warnings no longer appear when clicking a hexagon. Now returns the hexID of a hexagon when clicked. If user clicks the background (anywhere thats not a hexagon) then it prints invalid to java terminal. If user clicks a coloured hexagon then it prints to choose an empty hexagon to java terminal. 

-pop ups to indicate a players turn. While a pop up is active, the hexagons are disabled; clicks on them will have no action. The opacity of the hexagons is decreased while pop up is active to show this.

-currently starts on RED turn by default, then when a hexagon is clicked >hexagon coloured RED + blue turn pop up, straight to BLUE turn, and so on.

-there is now an arraylist of Polygons in HelloController called 'hexagons' containing all the hexagons which I used it for colouring the board grey, so if we need to make a change to all the hexagons down the line we can use this.  

-new files 'red.png' and 'blue.png' in resources folder, a red circle and blue circle used on the pop ups.

EXPLANATION

how the code currently runs:

RED TURN pop up > click a hexagon > getHexID() > PlayerTurn() > RedPlayer() > colours hexagon red + shows blue turn pop up > ...
... BLUE TURN pop up > click a hexagon > etc


-getHexID checks that the click is a valid hexagon. //valid in the sense that it is not already coloured. No game logic of valid placements//
-if the click is valid getHexID calls PlayerTurn() from HelloApplication class
-PlayerTurn checks the isRedTurn boolean variable to see whos turn it is, and either calls BluePlayer() or RedPlayer(). After it calls a players turn it changes the value of isRedTurn so next time around it will call other players method.
-BluePlayer() / RedPlayer() colours the clicked hexagon with their colour, and then calls to show the pop up indicating it is the other players turn. Then after this pop up, once another hexagon is clicked the process will repeat and this time the opposite player method will be called.
